As you can see binary layer extractions have been done not only on the frontal image without emotion, but also on the image with smile and also on the image with the head rotated. The results are quite similar as we can see the definitions and purposes of binary layers are not changing and whenever we want to detect for example inner facial area we are able to do it no matter the face is rotated or not.
